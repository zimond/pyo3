[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) bindings for [Python](https://www.python.org/). This includes running and interacting with Python code from a Rust binary, as well as writing native Python modules.

* User Guide: [stable](https://pyo3.rs) | [master](https://pyo3.rs/master)

* API Documentation: [stable](https://docs.rs/pyo3/) |  [master](https://pyo3.rs/master/doc)

A comparison with rust-cpython can be found [in the guide](https://pyo3.rs/master/rust_cpython.html).

## Usage

PyO3 supports Python 3.5 and up. The minimum required Rust version is 1.37.0-nightly 2019-07-19.

If you have never used nightly Rust, the official guide has
[a great section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html#rustup-and-the-role-of-rust-nightly)
about installing it.

PyPy is also supported (via cpyext) for Python 3.5 only, targeted PyPy version is 7.0.0.
Please refer to the guide for installation instruction against PyPy.

You can either write a native Python module in Rust, or use Python from a Rust binary.

However, on some OSs, you need some additional packages. E.g. if you are on *Ubuntu 18.04*, please run

```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev python-dev
```

## Using Rust from Python

PyO3 can be used to generate a native Python module.

**`Cargo.toml`**

```toml
[package]
name = "string-sum"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2018"

[lib]
name = "string_sum"
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies.pyo3]
version = "0.8.4"
features = ["extension-module"]
```

**`src/lib.rs`**

```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;
use pyo3::wrap_pyfunction;

#[pyfunction]
/// Formats the sum of two numbers as string
fn sum_as_string(a: usize, b: usize) -> PyResult<String> {
    Ok((a + b).to_string())
}

/// This module is a python module implemented in Rust.
#[pymodule]
fn string_sum(py: Python, m: &PyModule) -> PyResult<()> {
    m.add_wrapped(wrap_pyfunction!(sum_as_string))?;

    Ok(())
}
```

On Windows and Linux, you can build normally with `cargo build --release`. On macOS, you need to set additional linker arguments. One option is to compile with `cargo rustc --release -- -C link-arg=-undefined -C link-arg=dynamic_lookup`, the other is to create a `.cargo/config` with the following content:

```toml
[target.x86_64-apple-darwin]
rustflags = [
  "-C", "link-arg=-undefined",
  "-C", "link-arg=dynamic_lookup",
]
```

For developing, you can copy and rename the shared library from the target folder: On MacOS, rename `libstring_sum.dylib` to `string_sum.so`, on Windows `libstring_sum.dll` to `string_sum.pyd` and on Linux `libstring_sum.so` to `string_sum.so`. Then open a Python shell in the same folder and you'll be able to `import string_sum`.

To build, test and publish your crate as a Python module, you can use [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) or [setuptools-rust](https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust). You can find an example for setuptools-rust in [examples/word-count](examples/word-count), while maturin should work on your crate without any configuration.

## Using Python from Rust

Add `pyo3` to your `Cargo.toml` like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
pyo3 = "0.8.4"
```

Example program displaying the value of `sys.version` and the current user name:

```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;
use pyo3::types::IntoPyDict;

fn main() -> Result<(), ()> {
    let gil = Python::acquire_gil();
    let py = gil.python();
    main_(py).map_err(|e| {
        // We can't display python error type via ::std::fmt::Display,
        // so print error here manually.
        e.print_and_set_sys_last_vars(py);
    })
}

fn main_(py: Python) -> PyResult<()> {
    let sys = py.import("sys")?;
    let version: String = sys.get("version")?.extract()?;
    let locals = [("os", py.import("os")?)].into_py_dict(py);
    let code = "os.getenv('USER') or os.getenv('USERNAME') or 'Unknown'";
    let user: String = py.eval(code, None, Some(&locals))?.extract()?;
    println!("Hello {}, I'm Python {}", user, version);
    Ok(())
}
```

Our guide has [a section](https://pyo3.rs/master/python_from_rust.html) with lots of examples
about this topic.
